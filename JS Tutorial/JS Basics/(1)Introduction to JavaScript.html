    <!-- Ways to insert javascript  -->

    <script>
      console.log("Hello Console");
      //This will be displayed in the console part when you inspect your website.You can write this in the console itself.
    </script>
    <!-- This would take up a lot of space and the code would not look good .So we add the JS by creating a seperate file as shown below.Give the correct location of the external JS file in the src  -->
    <script src="JS/index.js"></script>

    <!--Console is a very powerful tool.All the javascript variable and function can be accessed from there.Used for debugging,as a calculator and to analyze a website  -->
    <!-- Go to console write console.log("Hello").It gives  the output as hello and also displays undefined which means that the function aint returning anything.  -->

    <!-- ECMA Script is a standard which JS follows/based.It was created to ensure that different JS are talking about the same thing. -->

    <!-- JS and ECMA SCript can be used interchangebly in almost all the cases.JS is very liberal in what it allows Ex:Semicolon etc.It autocorrects  stuff -->

    <!-- JS can be executed right inside one's browser.You can open the JS console and start writing JS there
    -->

    <!-- Another way to Execute JS is a runtime like node.js which can be installed and used to run JS code  -->

    <!-- Yet another way to execute js is by inserting it inside script tag of a html document -->

    <!-- Or use replit -->
