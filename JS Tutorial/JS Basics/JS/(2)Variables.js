//Variables are like containers n which various datatypes like string array int etc//
//JS is a dynamically typed language in which we  can change variable type during run time ie we can store a number ,array or a object in a string variable
//C is a statically typed language
//These  variables are stored in Memory


console.log("This repl contains code for the ultimate JS course video 2")
let a = 67 //a contains 67 . even var can be used
console.log(a)
a = "harry"
console.log(a)    //dynamically typed language

//Rules for choosing variables names 
//1) Letters , digits , underscores and dollar sign are allowed
//2) Must begin with a $ _ or a letter not a number
//3) JS reserved letters cannot be used
//4) Case sensitive
